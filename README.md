# Hybrid Image
Script that creates a hybrid image using Java.

## How to use
Upload same resolution images to resources folder and add them to _App.java_.

Currently the resource folder contains _einstein.bmp_ and _marilyn.bmp_ as a classic **hybrid image** example, and an image of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon for RGB band testing.

## Known issues
Using images of different resolutions makes the code crash.
