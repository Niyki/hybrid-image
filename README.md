# Hybrid Image

Script that creates a hybrid image using Java.

## How to use

Run _ImageFileBrowser.java_ and a simple UI will open. Using this UI select two images, one for low pass, and one for high pass respectively.

The resource folder can be used to hold more images but is not necessary. Currently it contains _einstein.bmp_ and _marilyn.bmp_ as a classic **hybrid image** example

## Known issues

Using images of different resolutions makes the code crash.
